			<b>Important:</b> In case you receive any Virus (Malware) warnings for our software downloads, this is almost certainly a FALSE POSITIVE and the software is actually clean/innocent.<br>
			Most "anti-virus" software today uses a <i>reputation</i> system, so your software will be flagged as "malware", simply because you are <i>not</i> a big company with millions of downloads.<br>
			Unfortunately, there is absolutely <u>nothing</u> that <i>we</i> could do to fix the FALSE POSITIVE, because the problem is <b>not</b> in our software. Please contact the "anti-virus" vendor support!
